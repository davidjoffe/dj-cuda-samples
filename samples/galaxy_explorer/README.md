# Galaxy Explorer

This is the project readme for Galaxy Explorer (in early development).

Much of our galaxy remains unmapped, and we have barely scratched the surface in exploring and mapping the Milky Way. Only in recent living history have we even begun to confirm planets outside the Solar System ("exoplanets"). This sample intends to encourage space exploration, education, mapping, foundations for software tools for possible future space travel, or possible game.

This sample does not require CUDA.
